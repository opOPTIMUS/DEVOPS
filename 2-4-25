DOCKER COMPOSE : 

**Docker Compose** is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications using a single YAML file. It allows you to configure services, networks,
and volumes for your app and run them with a single command (`docker-compose up`). 
Itâ€™s mainly used for local development to easily manage applications that require multiple containers, like a web app and a database.

DOCKER SWORM : 

Docker Swarm is a **container orchestration tool** built into Docker that helps you manage and deploy containerized applications across a cluster of machines. It allows you to:
- **Scale** applications by managing multiple containers across several hosts.
- Ensure **high availability** by automatically replacing failed containers.
- Use **load balancing** to distribute traffic evenly across containers.
- Manage services in a **declarative way**, meaning you define the desired state, and Swarm ensures it stays that way.
In essence, Docker Swarm makes it easier to manage and scale multi-container applications in production environments.
